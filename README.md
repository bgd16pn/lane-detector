# Lane detection processor for FPGA
A lane detector for identifying traffic lanes from a given static image reference. The proof of concept is written in Python, while the final purpose of this project is to implement it on FPGA using VHDL code.



Python implementation inspired by **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** built by Galen Ballew in December 2016 through the Udacity Self Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree.
